DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHM

Data Structure is a way data is organized for efficient access, efficient storage and efficient manipulation.
Algorithm refers to the step by step process in achieving a task.

- Linear Structure: array, linked list, stack, queue
	* Array is a collection of data that can be accessed via index
- Non linear Structure: binary tree

Time Complexity: how fast an algorithm runs a large input.
Space Complexity

Big O is a way of seeing how an algorithm performs in the worst case.
O(1) - constant time. NO matter the input, it'd still run at a constant time.
O(n) - the time increases with the input
O(log n) - 


ARRAY
	Deletion: O(n)
	Insertion: O
