Create a doubly linked list
Each nodes represents a song
A song is made up of:

class variable:
	song list: [];

methods are:
	repeat:
	delete:
	shuffle:
	add:
	loop:
	search(artist, title) - returns the id, that can be used by play.
	favorite: triggers isFavorite;
	play(id): only a song - if the id is not passed, use the search() to get the song id, and play by ID
	playAll: plays all the song in the list.
	showSongs:
	sortTitleAscending:
	sortTitleDescending:
	sortIdAscending
	sortIdDescending
	sortDurationAscending
	sortDurationDescending
	nowPlaying:
	sortByName:
	sortByTitle
	sortByDuration:
	// sort function takes an argument (A or D) for ascending or descending.
	isFavorite: boolean flag for liking a song
	playCount: increments by 'Play'
