Depth: the number of edges from the node to the root node
Height: the number of edges from the node to the leaf node.

A balanced BST is one in which the difference between the depth of each sub-trees is at most 1.

1. Inorder Traversal: LPR - Left Parent Right
2. Preorder Traversal: PLR - Parent Left Right
3. Postorder Traversal: LPR - Left Parent Right

7, 11, 12, 
3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19

BST: all the nodes on the right are greater than the nodes on the left.
