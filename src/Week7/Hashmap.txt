A hashmap is a data structure that takes a key and generates an index using a hashfunction by which it stores the key:value in a hashbucket.
The hashmap retrieves the key/data using the index, generated by the hashfunction.
It retrieves in O(1) time.

PROCEDURE:
1. Create the Hashtable, using the defined SIZE or CAPACITY
2. Create a good Hash function, to ensure collision is minimized
3. Using the hash function, generate the hash value or hash code for the key or data
4. Get the index for the key using the generated hash value % SIZE
5. Check if the poisition is empty, add. If not, add the new key to the beginning of the linked list.
