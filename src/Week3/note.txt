Aggregation is a special form of association where one class has a reference to another class but both can exist independently

An abstract class is a blueprint that cannot be directly instantiated, but can only be extended. It can include:
	- concrete method (with full implementation)
	- abstract methods (only the method signature, no implementation) because it is to be implemented by the child class.
